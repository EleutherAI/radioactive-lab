    "According to section 5.5 of the paper, even a marking network trained on a different\n",
    "data distribution will output radioactive markings that are useful when applied to at least 10% of a class. \n",
    "This number could vary, we are just quoting the minimum radioactive data percentage shown in the paper. </p>\n",
    "<p>If the marking network was trained on the same data distribution it is likely that a lower percentage of the\n",
    "   target data would require marking to achieve the same p value in the detection stage.</p>\n",
    "<p>When performing our testing we found that a 10% marking only produced a p-value of around 0.85, indicating that we should go higher. We are currently performing a range of tests on this.</p>"
